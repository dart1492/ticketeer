## Packages

This app was written with Clean Architecture and best software design patterns in mind. It makes use of classical Flutter packages, like:
- [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
- [Easy localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization)
- [Get it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)

I also want to mention some packages that provide specific functionality in specific parts of the app:
- [International phone field](https://pub.dev/packages/intl_phone_field). Provides neat phone TextField widget with extended functionality
- [Flutter credit card](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_credit_card). Provides credit card widget that can be tied with different TextField widgets to display credit card info: number, cvv, date, etc.
- [Barcode widget](https://pub.dev/packages/barcode_widget). Provides functionality to generate different barcode types based on some app data and display this barcode on the screen.

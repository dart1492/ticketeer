## General 🐱‍🐉
Ticketeer is a mobile app, built for [EMPAT](https://empat.tech/) Flutter Fundamentals course. I tried writing it with Clean Architecture and Bloc patterns in mind, experimenting in flexible parts of my application.

## Packages 📦
This app makes use of classic Flutter packages:
- [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
- [Easy localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization)
- [Get it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)

I also want to mention some packages that provide specific functionality in specific parts of the app:
- [International phone field](https://pub.dev/packages/intl_phone_field). Provides neat phone TextField widget with extended functionality
- [Flutter credit card](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_credit_card). Provides credit card widget that can be tied with different TextField widgets to display credit card info: number, cvv, date, etc.
- [Barcode widget](https://pub.dev/packages/barcode_widget). Provides functionality to generate different barcode types based on some app data and display this barcode on the screen.

You will be able to see all of them listed in pubspec.yaml file

## Release
I've decided to add github workflow to build and release apk here, in the [releases](https://github.com/dart1492/ticketeer/releases) section.
